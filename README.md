# Data Assetization Nodes

**Data Assetization Nodes** in the DataHive ecosystem are responsible for managing and tokenizing data assets. These nodes facilitate secure data transactions, ensuring that users can convert their data into digital assets that can be securely traded or monetized while maintaining control over its usage.

By leveraging decentralized technologies and blockchain integration, Data Assetization Nodes provide a transparent, secure, and user-controlled environment for managing data ownership and transactions.

## Features

- **Data Tokenization**: Convert user data into digital assets that can be securely traded or monetized within the decentralized ecosystem.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Ensure that all transactions are transparent, secure, and immutable through blockchain technology.
- **Decentralized Control**: Users retain full control over their data assets, with the ability to revoke or modify permissions at any time.
- **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with global privacy regulations such as GDPR by maintaining user consent and transparency in all transactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run a Data Assetization Node locally, you’ll need:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management
- A basic understanding of blockchain technology and data tokenization concepts

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/datahiv3/Data-Assetization-Nodes.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Data-Assetization-Nodes
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install  # Or use yarn install if you prefer Yarn
    ```

### Running the Node

To start running a Data Assetization Node locally:

1. Start the node:
    ```bash
    npm start  # Adjust according to your setup
    ```

2. The node should now be running locally on `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with it through API requests or integrate it with other parts of the DataHive ecosystem.

### Example API Request

Here’s an example of how you can tokenize a piece of data using an API request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tokenize \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"userId": "user123", "data": "Sample data to tokenize"}'
```

This will return a response with the tokenized version of the data.
